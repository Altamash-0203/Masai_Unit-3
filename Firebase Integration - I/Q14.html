Title:
L1 - Debugging: Fix the Broken Delete Function

Problem Statement:
You are provided with a pre-written function that is intended to delete a user from the Firebase Realtime Database. However, the function does not work as expected. Your task is to debug and fix the function.

Original Code:
const deleteUser = (key) => {
  fetch(`https://your-project-id.firebaseio.com/users/key.json`, {
    method: 'DELETE',
  })
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(() => {
    console.log("User deleted successfully");
  })
  .catch(error => console.error("Error deleting user:", error));
};

Your Tasks:
Identify and fix the bug(s) in the deleteUser function.
Ensure the function dynamically uses the correct key parameter to delete the user.
After deletion, remove the user entry from the displayed user table.
Submission Guidelines:
Submit your Masai Git directory link containing the fixed code and any additional files.
